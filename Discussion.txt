Increasing the number of iterations generally decreases the error. A log-log plot of error vs. N for 
some generated data is in the file "ErrorPlot.png". These data were generated using the default bounding box with sizes x = 10.0, y = 5.0, and z = 5.0.

As the size of the bounding box increases to high values, the error grows large and the value of the
overlap integral approaches zero.
